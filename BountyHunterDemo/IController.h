/// Summary:	Declares the IController interface. A controller is basically the mechanic that 
/// drives GameObjects. The GameObject itself only exhibits the behaviours like Move, Turn or Jump,
/// but has no will on its own. A controller can take controll (possess) a GameObject and will 
/// function as its brain. There are at least two different controller types. (1) The PlayerController:
/// this controller simply projects the players will onto the GameObject he/she controlls. This can as
/// easy as simply forwarding the player input to the approriate method of th eGameObject. (2) The
/// AIController: this controller has an AI algorithm running in the background that continuesely 
/// monitors the enviroment and react accoding to its stimuly.
